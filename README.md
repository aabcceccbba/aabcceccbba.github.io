## Hello World

I'm Kaiyue Lu, majoring in Computer Science in University of Virginia :)

I have done a bunch of things:

### Research

- I am currently working on the automatic repair project with Professor Upsorn.

- I used Unity and Visual Studio to add features and adjust attributes of meshed models, and connect the model to the HoloLens.

This is the [research description](https://secure.rutgers.edu/urs/projects/projectDetails.aspx?ID=3001).

### Internship

I interned at Bruce Arnold Foundation during Summer, 2016. I worked on an ear training music application using JUCE, and designed GUI for the MIDI I/O.

In Summer 2015, I interned at CTCE Group and I debugged and optimized webpage and updating problems.
