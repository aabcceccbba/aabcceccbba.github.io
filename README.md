## Hello World

I'm Kaiyue Lu, majoring in Computer Science in University of Virginia :)

I have done a bunch of things:

### Research

- I am currently working on the automatic repair project with Professor Upsorn.

- I used Unity and Visual Studio to add features and adjust attributes of meshed models, and connect the model to the HoloLens.

This is the [research description](https://secure.rutgers.edu/urs/projects/projectDetails.aspx?ID=3001).

### Internship

I interned at AEEC this Summer, 2018. Our team was working on an alert web application by using Google Cloud Platform tools. The application uses Flask framework. We also do data analysis/prediction based on history data sent to us.

I interned at Bruce Arnold Foundation during Summer, 2016. I worked on an ear training music application using JUCE, and designed GUI for the MIDI I/O.
