## Hello World

I'm Kaiyue, working as a Software Dev Engineer in Amazon :)

I graduated with Computer Science degree in University of Virginia.

I have done a bunch of things:

### Jobs

- I'm currently working on Amazon core data platform as a SDE. The service is implemented to ingest data from the source database, make transformation between DDB tables based on customers' specific use case, and generate bulk export for all types of customers.

- I previously worked as Cloud Support Engineer in AWS, mainly focusing on troubleshooting system/network/services related issues in Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, SNS, IoT, etc.

### Internship

- I interned at AEEC in 2018. Our team was working on an alert web application by using Google Cloud Platform tools. The application uses Flask framework. We also do data analysis/prediction based on history data sent to us.

- I interned at Bruce Arnold Foundation during Summer, 2016. I worked on an ear training music application using JUCE, and designed GUI for the MIDI I/O.

### Research

- I worked on automatic repair project with Professor Upsorn.

- I used Unity and Visual Studio to add features and adjust attributes of meshed models, and connect the model to the HoloLens.
